# Welcome
Collecting patient reporting outcomes should not be difficult. We demonstrate that we can do this using an off the shelf content management system. The secret sauce is of course the CMS - Drupal. The repository has the required documentation so you can get up and running with a customised installation of Drupal such that you can collect and evaluate patient reported outcomes in the clinic.
